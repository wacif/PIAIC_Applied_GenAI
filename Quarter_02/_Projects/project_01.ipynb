He'd watched the sky blush pink at dawn, a shy, hesitant greeting to the world. He'd seen it blaze with the fierce, unforgiving blue of midday, a testament to the sun's unwavering power. And he'd witnessed the slow, melancholic descent into twilight, the sky bleeding hues of orange, purple, and gold, a final, breathtaking curtain call.\n\nToday, the sky was a study in grey. Not a dull, lifeless grey, but a complex, layered grey, like a charcoal drawing. Heavy, pregnant clouds hung low, promising rain. Hemlock, his weathered face a roadmap of time, felt a kinship with the somber mood. He knew the sky wasn't sad, not really.
